# Event Read ACLs for UNITs on Starknet

By default, events emitted by Starknet contracts are public and readable by any user.
This follows standard Starknet behavior.

## Proposed Standard: Fine-grained Event Read ACLs

UNITs introduces a new standard where contracts can define granular access controls for reading events through a specific function:

- `can_read_event`

### How it Works

When a user attempts to read events from a contract, the RPC will:

1. Call `can_read_event` with the event selectors to check
2. Receive boolean array indicating read permissions
3. Only return the requested events if their corresponding boolean is `true`
4. If the function doesn't exist (for compatibility with existing contracts on Starknet), all events are public by default

### Example Implementation

Here's an example of how to implement event read access control in Cairo (Note: This is a conceptual example for
illustration purposes only and has not been tested on-chain):

```cairo
#[starknet::interface]
trait IEventReadACL {
    fn can_read_event(selectors: Array<felt252>) -> Array<bool>;
}

#[starknet::contract]
mod MyContract {
    use starknet::ContractAddress;
    use array::ArrayTrait;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        admin: ContractAddress,
        private_event_selectors: LegacyMap::<felt252, bool>,
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(ref self: ContractState, admin: ContractAddress) {
        self.admin.write(admin);

        // Example: Mark specific events as private
        self.private_event_selectors.write(selector!("PrivateTransfer"), true);
        self.private_event_selectors.write(selector!("ConfidentialMint"), true);
    }

    #[external(v0)]
    fn can_read_event(self: @ContractState, selectors: Array<felt252>) -> Array<bool> {
        let mut result = ArrayTrait::new();
        let caller = starknet::get_caller_address();
        let is_admin = caller == self.admin.read();

        // Check each selector
        let mut i: u32 = 0;
        loop {
            if i >= selectors.len() {
                break;
            }

            let selector = *selectors.at(i);
            // If event is not marked as private, it's public
            // If it is private, only admin can read it
            let can_read = !self.private_event_selectors.read(selector) || is_admin;
            result.append(can_read);

            i += 1;
        };

        result
    }
}
```

### Backward Compatibility

For contracts without the `can_read_event` function, events remain publicly readable.
This preserves compatibility with existing contracts while enabling granular controls in new ones.
